    The @fun{graphene:with-objects} macro creates new variable bindings and
    executes the body that use these bindings.
  @end{short}
  The macro performs the bindings sequentially, like the @sym{let*} macro.

  Each object can be initialized with values using the syntax for the
  @fun{graphene:with-object} macro. See also the @fun{graphene:with-object}
  documentation.
